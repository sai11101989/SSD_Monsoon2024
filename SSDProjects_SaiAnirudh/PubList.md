**Project:** List Publications from Publication Repositories for Research Centres

**Context:** Computer Research Labs and Computer Researchers (especially in Computer Science) face challenges on manually listing their publication information on their personal webpages or research centers. **Sulochana** is a PhD Research Scholar at one of the research labs at IIT Kashmir and is was tasked to update the publication page of their research center on month-on-month basis. This activity needs to be automated so as to avoid manual updates on personal pages of researchers and also on the Research Lab websites.

**Resources:** 
* DBLP Publication API: https://dblp.org/faq/How+to+use+the+dblp+search+API.html
* Google Scholar API: https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api
* Google Scholar Playground: https://serpapi.com/playground?engine=google_scholar&q=Coffee&hl=en

**Input:** Read the researcher details and sent it to the respective API

**Output:** Generate a list of publications coming through the API and display them group by year, author, type of publication in a pagingation format

**Chornology of Tasks:**
* Identify list of authors and read the data from the publication APIs in BIB format
* Write a JavaScript library to parse the BIB file and display publication data group by year, author and type of publication in a pagination format
* Any research center should be able to use the JavaScript library to fetch, parse BIB files and display

**Stakeholders:**
* Sulochana: uses the JavaScript library on her personal website and her research center website so that the required publications can be fetched, parsed and displayed.
