**Project:** SHELL program for Log Analysis

**Context:** Komal recently joined Department of Finance, Government of Telangana recently as a IT Support staff. She is required to support, maintain and manage the machines of Finance Department. Despite being skilled as System Administrator, she is piled up with too much workload. The machines in the Finance department are decade old running on Ubuntu with poor performance. Komal urges the head of IT to upgrade the machines but the IT team insists her to provide us the proof of performance degradation. She had thoughts of building a simple SHELL program to analyze OS logs to provide proof of performance degradation due to memory issues on these older machines. However, due to heavy workload she couldn't spend energy on building this SHELL program.

Komal needs your help to build a Log Analyzer that can read the OS logs and provides insights so that she can share relevant proof of performance degradation on these older machines with her IT head and get the machines upgraded with latest memory.
